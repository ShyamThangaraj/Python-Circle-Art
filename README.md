## Introduction

This repository contains Python scripts using the Turtle graphics library to draw different shapes and patterns. Each program demonstrates different functionalities of the Turtle graphics library.

## Programs

### Setup

The `setup` program initializes the turtle and draws a horizontal line.

### For Loops

The `forLoops` program uses nested for loops to draw a square pattern.

### Two

The `two` program draws a pattern resembling a zigzag line.

### Three

The `three` program draws triangles and squares in a repeating pattern.

### Four

The `four` program draws colored rectangles.

### Five

The `five` program draws concentric circles.

### Six

The `six` program draws a spiral pattern using circles.

### Seven

The `seven` program creates a colorful pattern by drawing circles with varying radii.

## Usage

1. Run the desired script:

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

2. Observe the Turtle graphics window to see the drawn shapes or patterns.

Feel free to explore and modify the programs to experiment with different shapes and patterns.
